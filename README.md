This project is my take on The Odin Projects's Etch-a-Sketch challenge page.

Drag your mouse around the screen to "draw" into the pixels. Use the provided buttons
to clear the screen or change the "resolution" of the pixels.

Added touch support. Works with touch capable devices, but only tested on an Android phone.
